### 2.4.2 Division of Responsibility

Under the Code of Virginia, Section 42. 1-35, the Library Board of T rustees "shall adopt such bylaws, rules, and regulations for their own guidance and for the government of the free public library system as may be expedient. They shall have control of the expenditures of all bequests of money, personal property, or real estate for the establishment and maintenance of such free public library systems or endowments for same." Thus, in defining and delineating the the division of responsibility between the Board and the Library Director, the Board recognizes that the ultimate responsibility to the community rests with the Board. Policy determination is the Board's power and duty. Management is the Library Director's responsibility, for which he or she is responsible to the Board. The division and sharing of these responsibilities fall into several categories.

1. Goals and Objectives for the Library
	1. Responsibility of Board - It shall be the duty of the Board to determine the goals and objectives of the Library and the methods of meeting them, to review the goals and objectives annually, and to evaluate progress.
	2. Responsibility of Library Director - The Library Director shall provide assistance and direction in setting goals and objectives and in determining means of evaluation.
	3. Joint Responsibility - The Board shall relate the Library and its program to the community and its needs through systematic study of the community and through systematic analysis of library service with the assistance of the Library Director, who shall participate fully and shall prepare regular reports on current progress and future needs.
