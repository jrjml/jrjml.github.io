### 3.3 Electronic Device Policy
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Patron-Owned Devices
Staff must not modify, use, or handle patron-owned devices unless the patron has a medical or other serious incapacity preventing them from doing so themselves. In the case of such an incapacity to operate the device properly, the staff member must handle the device lightly and not lift it or carry it.  Staff must not give technology “advice”, rather Staff may help patrons by locating the information resources for them to use and accomplish their task(s) effectively.  If this is ineffective, Staff are permitted to offer them use of a Library-Owned Device such as a computer (to be checked-out to that patron).

#### Library-Owned Devices
When helping patrons using Library-owned devices (Library PCs, Library Laptop, Library Projector, etc) Staff must always attempt to give patrons the information resources for them to use and accomplish task(s) effectively, on their own.  If this is ineffective, Staff are permitted to use the Library-owned device in an attempt to help the patron accomplish their task(s) effectively with the caveat that, if their personal files are lost or damaged, the Library is not responsible.

Some patrons need more help than others.  However, we are under no contract or obligation to do patrons' taxes, apply them for jobs, write their book reports, crop their photos, buy them products, or otherwise complete their tasks for them.  The obligation to help a patron is implicit in our mission to provide information services. Patrons needing large amounts of help (particularly those who do not know how to use a computer) should be encouraged to perform as much of the task(s) as they are comfortable doing.

Portable Library-owned devices (laptops, projectors, etc) must only be checked out to patrons with valid and current Library card accounts (never use a guest pass).  This is so that if the equipment is damaged we have a record of the patron and all of their contact information. Portable Library-owned devices are never to leave the Library, and are to be examined for damage upon check-in and check-out per normal circulation policy.

#### Staff-Owned Devices
Staff should turn off their phones or silence them while working.  Use of such devices is not permitted in the circulation area or the circulation desk unless with permission from the Director.
