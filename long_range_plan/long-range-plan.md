# Disaster Plan
## J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library
### 14.1 Long Range Plan
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Forward

The Appomattox County Library has been serving the community of Appomattox, Virginia since our very first public Library began in 1936. The growing collection of nearly five-thousand books was moved in 1940 into a space which would be large enough to house it. By 1992, a half-century later, that collection had quadrupled in size and the Library was, finally, moved into its current home on 157 Main Street as the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library.

The Library's collection is still growing and includes paperbacks, hardbacks, audio discs, video discs, newspapers, magazines, e-books, and sixteen public internet terminals and two public catalog terminals. We offer affordable document printing, copying, scanning, and fax from a single public all-in-one terminal and two public scanning terminals. The Library's collection is maintained by a Commonwealth of Virginia Certified Librarian, two full-time staff, and two to four part-time staff. Using an open-source Library Management System, we are able to provide all these services to thousands of patrons locally and throughout the Commonwealth.

In the next five years we aim to enhance our existing community services including digital literacy, early literacy, and cultural awareness. We will also seek to establish new resource avenues and provide patrons with the highest standard of resources to meet their every information need.

#### Library Mission Statement

The mission of the Appomattox County Library is to provide the population of hte county with access to knkowledge, ideas, and creative expression by collecting and offering print resources, audio-visual materials, and electronic information services which are of interest to the community; to assure ease of access to these materials; and to provide programs to stimulate the awareness and use of these resources by establishing access to human informational and creative resources of Appomattox County and beyond. The Appomattox County Library offers a welcoming and inspiring environment for learning and individual enlightenment and community enrichment throughout the region.

#### Library Purposes

The Appomattox County Library has four primary roles. These roles reflect the objectives of the individual patrons of the Library:

	1. Popular Materials Library - Makes available current materials of high interest in a variety of formats for persons of all ages.
	2. Reference Library - Provides timely, accurate information and reference services employing a highly qualified, professional staff.
	3. Education Support and Independent Learning Center - Supports the educational goals of all Commonwealth citizens by providing resources which correspond to their diverse needs.
	4. Preschool and School-Age Children's Library - Encourages young children to develop a love of reading, learning, and libraries by providing materials and programs for children, as well as for their parents and caregivers.
	5. Adult and Senior Outreach Center - Encourages community development, cultural enrichment, and establishes the foundation for increased adult learning and adult circulation.

As an institution which helps individuals develop their own convictions and pursue personal opportunities, the library plays an important role in the operation of a free and democratic society. Serving students of all ages the Library is part of the educational structure of the community. The Library serves residents as well as government, clubs, organizations, businesses, industry, social services, artistic and religious institutions, providing information service to the community as a whole. The diverse nature of the community is reflected in the collections and services of the library.

The Appomattox County Library serves people of all ages, backgrounds, and persuasions, respecting their individual library needs. Proudly upholding the public's freedom of access to information, the Library does not restrict access to facts, ideas, and creative expression, unless restricted by law, to any member of the community.

#### Goals and Objectives

Listed below are the Library's goals subsequent objectives for the fiscal years 2017 through 2022, as well as expected completion dates. They represent a variety of options of interesting and important avenues which would increase the Library's capacity to meet patron's information needs. These objectives are a framework for achieving important goals for the Library. Specific activities and tasks will be developed around this framework using this document as a reference.

1. GOAL: Professional Services

	Preventative maintenance, equipment purchasing strategies, and patron enrichment can be achieved through a variety of services.

	1. Objective: Technology Planning - End of 2017

		There should be a comprehensive strategy for equipment purchasing. A computer life-cycle and replacement schedule has been determined to be a valid avenue regarding this. More assessment is needed into our current technology situation to determine other possible opportunities for technology planning.

	2. Objective: Patron Education - End of 2019

		A general reference LibGuide would give us an interactive and useful tool to ensure easy access to library information for both staff, director, the board, and patrons. Assessment is needed to determine whether technology education courses could be implemented to improve patrons' effectiveness at typing, mobile computing, and word processing.

	3. Objective: Internet Resources - End of 2018

		The Library would benefit from its server through local webhosting. This would increase upload times for web development and allow for more precise customization and design specifications. An increase in internet speed would improve this and many areas of our patrons' services.

2. GOAL: Day-to-day Business
	
	There are a few ways the day-to-day operations here at the Library could be improved. Having a direct impact on patron and staff these improvements would need to be carefully planned and based on sound assessment policies.

	- Job Descriptions (Completed End of 2016)

		Job descriptions should be assessed and modified as necessary. Various options for improvement could be more specialization, less specialization, cross-specialization, etc. With half-a-dozen staff including the Director the adequate designation, assignment, and fulfillment of job descriptions is a priority.
		
	- Online Training and Staff Involvement (Completed End of 2016)

		The Library is unique in the area for its open-source software usage. The use of this software promises to increase service effectiveness while reducing costs. However, it is important that the staff be included in study, training, and development of its open-source software as well as all other aspects of circulation and collection development.

	1. Objective: Accounting Database - End of 2021

		The management, expenditure, intake, and disbursement of funds currently takes the form of physical media. Line item actions of all types including purchasing, cash handling, deposits, and counts could be done digitally. Most businesses do this because it increases accuracy and dependability of the figures, speeds up the process, requires less materials, and is more secure when properly maintained. A SWOT analysis as well as much research would be needed to implement something this overarching. Pilot programs and tests would also be needed in advance of any commitment to this or any similar strategy.

3. GOAL: Programming
	
	Library programming and other organized Library/community interaction should be done with care and be managed closely to ensure proper Library/community integration.

	- Outreach Promotions (Completed End of 2016)

		Promotional efforts should take various forms and reach patrons through appropriate channels to ensure continued community involvement. Assessment is needed to determine specific opportunities in this area.

	1. Objective: Outreach Opportunities - End of 2017

		Evaluate and explore new opportunities for outreach. Assessment, including comparative analyses between patron and overall community demographics, is needed. Programs should reflect as closely as possible the needs of its patrons while also encouraging participation from unserved groups.

	2. Objective: Digital Literacy - End of 2022

		Identify ways which the Library can foster the digital literacy of patrons. A public Library with this many public computers is perfectly poised to lead the way in digital literacy. Be it taking the form of in-house training and lessons, an organized system of referals and registering patrons for training outside of the Library, a combination of the two, or an altogether different approach, I believe we atleast need to be more involved than we courrently are.

4. GOAL: Equipment and Maintenance

	The physical environment in which we operate, serve patrons, conduct meetings, hold gatherings, and care for materials need to be of high standard. The current physical environment is in need of assessment to determine strategies for improvement.

	- Handicapped Accessibility (Completed End of 2016)

		Various regulations exist about handicapped accessibility requirements for public buildings. The Library needs to assess its current situation and remedy any shortcomings.

	1. Objective: General Building Interior Improvements - End of 2018

		Examine the whole number of problems and assess priorities. Possible candidates for repair and improvement would be recovering and/or repairing the ceiling, walls, and/or tiles, ensuring efficient energy usage, and assessing storage for streamlining and expansion options.

	2. Objective: General Building Exterior Improvements - End of 2017

		Assuring that the national and state flags are properly cared for and elluminated is a simple and effective way of improving the Library's exterior appearance as well as the downtown skyline. Replacing broken fixtures and maintaining the gardens and brickwork is also very important.

	3. Objective: Server Enclosure - End of 2018

		The server currently occupies the corner of the Director's office. Relocation of this server and possible enclosure of the server would contain and exhaust heat properly, reducing energy costs, and it would reduce the amount of dust taken in by the fans.
