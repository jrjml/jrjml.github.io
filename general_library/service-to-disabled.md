### 4.9 Service to Disabled
[< Table of Contents][0]

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library offers the same services to patrons with disabilities as to all other segments of the population. In addition to those services, the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library acts as a facilitator between the patron and Virginia State Library for the Visually and Physically Handicapped, offers outreach services to patrons with disabilities which prevent them from coming to the Library, and welcomes service animals in the Library.

*Adopted by the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library Board of Trustees on December 14, 2000*
