### 5.2 Unattended Children Policy
[< Table of Contents][0]

The J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is dedicated to providing a welcoming, exciting, and safe environment for people of all ages, including the youth of the community.  The responsibility for the safety and behavior of children in the Library rests with the parent or caregiver and not with Library personnel.  The following guidelines will be followed concerning the care and behavior of young Library users:

1. Children under the age of 8 may not be left unattended in the Library.  A child is unattended if he or she is in the Library without a parent or responsible adult over the age of 18.  An exception would be a child attending storytime or other Library program without a parent or caregiver in the room.  However, the parent or caregiver must remain in the Library building and immediately join the child at the end of the program.  If a child in this age group is found unattended, the Library staff will attempt to located the parent or caregiver and inform him or her of the rules.  If a child in this age group violates the Code of Conduct, the child and the parent or caregiver will be informed of the rules.  If inappropriate behavior continues, the family may be asked to leave the Library.
2. Children ages 8 through 12 may use the Library on their own and are thereby subject to Library rules and policies concerning behavior, conduct, and demeanor.  However, parents are still responsible for the actions of their child.  Children using inappropriate behavior will be informed of the rules.  If inappropriate behavior continues the offender(s) may be asked to leave the Library.  If a child in this age group is not able to leave the Library without an adult, the child should not be in the Library without an adult.  This is of particular concern in inclement weather and after dark.  All children should have the telephone number of someone who can assist them in an emergency.
3. Young people ages 13 through 17 are treated as adult users and are expected to abide by Library rules and policies concerning behavior, conduct, and demeanor. However, they are still legally the responsibility of their parents.
4. At closing time, children of all ages who do not have transportation home will be asked for telephone numbers of people who can pick them up at the Library. If transportation is not available within thirty (30) minutes of closing, the appropritate law enforcement officials will be asked to pick up the child. Under no circumstances will a staff member give a child a ride home.
5. The Library assumes no responsibility for any child left unattended in the Library.
6. All Library patrons are subject to regular Library rules concerning disruptive behavior.

Whenever advisable, the Library will notify the parent of incidents involving an unattended child.  Library privileges may be suspended if found in violation of this policy.  In any situation involving youth safety and specifically whenever parents or law enforcement officials are contacted, Library staff will complete an Incident Report. The Unattended Child Policy shall be posted in the Library.
